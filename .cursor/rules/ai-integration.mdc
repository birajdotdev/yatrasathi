# YatraSathi AI Integration Guidelines

This project uses AI features through the AI SDK. Follow these guidelines when implementing AI functionality.

## AI SDK Implementation

### Core Principles
- Use the AI SDK for structured AI interactions
- Implement proper error handling for AI responses
- Provide fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable
- Consider rate limits and costs in implementation

### Google AI Integration
- Use `@ai-sdk/google` for Google AI model integration
- Follow Google AI usage guidelines and best practices
- Implement proper authentication for API access

### UI Patterns
- Show loading states during AI processing
- Provide clear feedback for AI-generated content
- Allow users to regenerate or modify AI responses
- Implement progressive enhancement (app works without AI)

## Stream Handling

- Use streaming responses for better user experience
- Implement proper UI feedback during streaming
- Handle streaming errors gracefully
- Consider debouncing for input fields that trigger AI

## Prompt Engineering

- Create well-structured, clear prompts
- Use system messages to set context and constraints
- Provide examples for complex tasks (few-shot learning)
- Test prompts with various inputs to ensure robustness

## Data Privacy

- Never send sensitive user data to AI services
- Implement proper data masking before sending to AI
- Be transparent with users about AI usage
- Follow relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize token usage to reduce costs
- Use caching for common AI responses
- Implement request throttling to prevent abuse
- Consider implementing client-side AI for appropriate use cases

## Testing AI Features

- Create specific tests for AI integrations
- Mock AI responses in tests for consistency
- Test edge cases (empty prompts, long responses, etc.)
- Implement monitoring for AI service health

## Accessibility

- Ensure AI-generated content maintains accessibility
- Provide alternative flows for users who opt out of AI
- Test AI features with assistive technologies
- Avoid AI-only functionality without fallbacks
