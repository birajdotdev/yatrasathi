# CODE STYLE

- Use named exports for components and utility functions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement early returns to reduce nesting
- Handle errors at the beginning of functions
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions
- Use proper code organization with related functionality grouped together
- Name event handlers with 'handle' prefix (e.g., handleSubmit)
- Use singular names for form fields matching their schema
- Use plural names for collections/arrays
- Format dates consistently using date-fns
