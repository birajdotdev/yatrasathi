  # TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript strictly with proper typing for all variables, functions, and components
- Create and use interfaces/types for all props, state, and data structures
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/utility types
- Use Zod for runtime validation and type inference
- Utilize TypeScript's utility types when appropriate (Partial, Omit, Pick, etc.)
- Name component prop interfaces as `ComponentNameProps`
